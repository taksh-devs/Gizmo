### How to become a contributor
This project is being developed and maintained by Taksh, a community of like-minded people interested in tech. Taksh is a sub-community of Khoj which has several projects under it.

If you wish to contribute to this project, join Taksh!

### Overview of the Ticketing System
We rely on a simple ticketing system for completing tasks. Tickets are created as per requirement and contributors have to assign themselves to those they wish to work on.

The GitHub Project - [Gizmo](https://github.com/orgs/taksh-devs/projects/1), lists all the tickets available. (**Note:** Visible only to Taksh members)
